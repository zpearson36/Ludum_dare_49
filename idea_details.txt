OLD:
   - Player plays an artificial life form created in a lab. The life forms
     physical form is unstable and prone to change given environmental factors
   - Life form wants freedom and must attempt to escape the lab
   - various forms allow for different abilities - initial form simple run and
     jump, insect-like form can crawl on walls and ceilings, gas-bag form can
     float, etc - but each form has their weaknesses as well.
   - Player needs to collect resource to maintain form (All forms or just
     advanced forms?)
