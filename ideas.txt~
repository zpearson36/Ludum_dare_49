 - Game where Ball is initially at rest in a stable position, but alterations
   to the environment cause it to become unstable and require the player to
   react in some way to get the ball back into a stable position

 - A game where each of the players inputs causes the game itself to become
   increasingly unstable, require player to solve puzzle in as few inputs as
   possible

 - A game where the player must try to prevent an 'usntable' character from
   losing their cool - avoid stressful situations

 - a game where the player must try to get an 'unstable' character to lose
   their cool - induce stressful situations

 - A game where the player removes horses from a stable

 - Dialogue based game where the player must interact with some entity
   (Person, AI, Alien, Eldrich Horror?) and try to keep them from losing their
   cool. Additional mechanic could be that then player must also monitor their
   own stress during the exchange (More stressed player is fewer 'good path'
   options?)

   change form/function, changing the players characters abilities and
   behaviors
