 - Puzzle Platformer where environmental factors causes the player character to
   change form/function, changing the players characters abilities and
   behaviors
   - Player plays an artificial life form created in a lab. The life forms
     physical form is unstable and prone to change given environmental factors
   - Life form wants freedom and must attempt to escape the lab
   - various forms allow for different abilities - initial form simple run and
     jump, insect-like form can crawl on walls and ceilings, gas-bag form can
     float, etc - but each form has their weaknesses as well.

 - base building/ farming game where player starts in a stable environment but
   must be careful not to disturb the world around them too much while
   attempting to survive, or could cause catastrophic ecosystem collapse
   - Not necessarily an "Earth" farm. Could be some alien environment where
     environmental pressures cause immediate feedback
   - Game would ultimately be a "Spreadsheet" Game, where the player
     manipulates certain variables in the "table" and other values change as a
     result
   - Player needs resources to build/maintain homestead/base.
   - Amount of resources available in environment affect amount of wild life
     which in turn affects the amount of resources (I.E. Number of trees
     affects the number of animal A, which affects the number of animal B, which in
     turn affects the number of trees)
   - Potentially too complex and time consuming. Possibly a non-jam project
