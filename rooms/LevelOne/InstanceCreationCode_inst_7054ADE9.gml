"Welcome to my game. You are the floating smoke you see to your left. You are able to move in any direction but you lack weight enough to interact with the most objects in the environment. The Exception, ofcourse, are the living creatures you find along the way. You must take control of their bodies (as you are wont to do, being magic smoke) and use them to find a way out of each room. Look there (to the right)! An unassuming slime. Lets practice. Your color will change once you are close enough to take control."
